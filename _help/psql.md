`CREATE DATABSE datbasename;`
**connect to your database at the beggining of the shell. or you can just.**
\c datbasename;

\*\*To delete a databse

`
DROP DATABASE datbasename;
`

\*\*To create a table inside a dtabase

`
CREATE TABLE tablename(
 Column name + data type + constraints if any
);

`

\*\*\d to list all the tables.

**`\d tablename` to list all columns inside the** table.\*\*

**DROP TABLE tablename to Drop that table.**

BIGSERAIL data type is int , and it is autoinceremental.

To add data into tables

`
INSERT INTO tablename (
first_name,
last_name,
gender,
date_of)BIRTH)


VALUES ('shuja','shah','male', DATE 1999-11-27);
`

To see all the data inside a table

`
SELECT * FROM tablename
`

To find specific info , like data where a column ends with a letter or a string use.

`
SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE columnname LIKE '%thestringyouarelookingfor';

`

To find info at a specific range, you use Between AND like this :

`SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE columnname BETWEEN 'ur_range-min' AND 'ur_range_max'; `

You can also chain two specifc columns using AND (it's plain english)

`
SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE columnname = bool AND columnname2 < 1;
`

**You can also use operation to check for two conditions. LIKE OR**

**You can also use not equal operator like !=**

**You can also use IN operator to check for multiple values in a column.**
like

`
SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE columnname IN ('value1','value2','value3');
`

**You can also use NOT IN operator to check for multiple values in a column.**
like

`
SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE columnname NOT IN ('value1','value2','value3');
`

**You can also use ORDER BY to sort the data **in a column.
like (default is ascending order for decending order use DESC)

`
SELECT * FROM tablename ORDER BY columnname;
`

**You can also use LIMIT to limit the number **of rows you want to see.
like

`
SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT 2;
`

**You can also use OFFSET to skip the first n** rows.
like

`
SELECT * FROM tablename OFFSET 2;
`

**You can also use LIMIT and OFFSET together.**
like

`
SELECT * FROM tablename LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;
`

**You can also use DISTINCT to remove duplica**te rows.
like

`
SELECT DISTINCT columnname FROM tablename;
`
